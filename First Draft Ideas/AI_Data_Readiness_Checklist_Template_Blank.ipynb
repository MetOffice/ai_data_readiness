    "## **Overview**\n",
    "The checklist is developed using the 2019 draft readiness matrix developed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy Subcommittee on Open Science as a basis. The checklist has been improved based on further research and user feedback. Definitions for some concepts are listed at the end of this document. This checklist is developed through a collaboration of ESIP Data Readiness Cluster members include representatives from NOAA, NASA, USGS, and other organizations. The checklist will be updated periodically to reflect community feedback.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Ideally for AI-ready assessment, a dataset should be defined as the minimum measurable bundle (i.e., a physical parameter/variable of observational datasets or model simulations). The assessment at this scale will enable better integration of data from different sources for research and development. However, it can be an intensive process for manual assessment without automation. Therefore, we recommend current assessments be done on the data file level. If the dataset has different versions, the checklist should be applied to each dataset type (e.g. raw, derived).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "* Know how to check a range of dataset features. \n",
    "* Assess a wide range of dataset features, which will impact the dataset's 'readiness' for machine learning.  \n",
