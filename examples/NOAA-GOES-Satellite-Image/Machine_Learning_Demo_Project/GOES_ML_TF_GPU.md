## Running on GPUs!
This project was amended to run on GPUs for the hackathon cloud platform. 
You need to create a new conda environment with all the usual packages you need: numpy, matplotlib etc... but install the tensorflow-gpu package (not tensorflow). 
You should then be able to run this project on a GPU.
